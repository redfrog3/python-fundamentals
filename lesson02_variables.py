#variables are flexible. you create or update another variable like so:
count = 19
print(count)
count_down = count - 1
print(count_down)
count = count_down
print(count)
count_down = count +5
print(count_down)
count = count_down

# challenge 1: Rename Variables
# change the variable names x, y, z below to more descriptive names.

x = "Radia Perlam"
y = 34
z = "Networing Engineer"


# 2

count = 10
print(count)
count_down = count +5
print(count_down)
count = count_down 

#3 swaping variables

x = 4
y = "hello"
z = y
y = x
x = z
